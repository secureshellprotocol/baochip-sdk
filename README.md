# Baochip SDK

This is a baremetal SDK for the Baochip Dabao Bao1x evaluation board. Most of
the work here is about peripheral drivers, linker scripts, firmware blob
signing, and examples to demonstrate driver usage. The strategy here is to do
drivers in no_std Rust for safety and make the public API usable from both Rust
and C for compatibility.

**CAUTION:** This is a proof of concept. I make no promises about maintaining
this code nor implementing missing features. The point of this is to document
how to do bare metal stuff with the bao1x. Feel free to chop this up for parts
and use it in your own projects.


## Roadmap

1. ✅ Implement Rust drivers and usage examples for timers, GPIO, and UART.

2. ✅ Add a C FFI layer over the drivers.

3. ✅ Get MicroPython working with the minimal set of drivers.

4. Possible maybe future stuff:
   - Convert Makefile rules for C library stuff to use the xpack toolchain
   - Add USB CDC-ACM serial support
   - Experiment with making rv32e apps for the BIO cores (LED drivers?)
   - Write more docs
   - More USB stuff like maybe CDC-NCM networking with an IP stack


## Dev Environment Setup

These instructions are for Debian 13 (Trixie), but they should probably work
with minimal modifications on whatever the latest Ubuntu LTS release is.
You're on your own for adapting to other Linux flavors, Windows, or macOS.

1. Install build essential, python3, gcc rv32 compiler, binutils, picolibc, 
   and libsodium library:

   ```
   sudo apt install build-essential python3 \
     binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf \
     gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf \
     picolibc-riscv64-unknown-elf \
     libsodium-dev
   ```

   Picolibc includes are at `/usr/lib/picolibc/riscv64-unknown-elf/include`,
   and `/usr/lib/picolibc/riscv64-unknown-elf/lib/release/rv32imac/ilp32` has
   the release builds of the libraries. This is for Debian. YMMV for Ubuntu.

   Libsodium is used for signing our compiled binary. 

2. Install Rust using the rustup install procedure at:

   [rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/](https://rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/)

   If you're allergic to piping curl into a shell, download the script on your
   own first and give it a read before you run it. You might also consider
   selecting the script's "Customize installation" option and telling it not to
   automatically modify your PATH, then modify PATH manually yourself.

   You may have to re-source your shell's rc file (eg `source ~/.bashrc`) to
   pick up any automatic PATH changes which haven't taken effect yet (if you
   opted to do so)

3. Install the riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf target and the llvm-tools component
   with rustup:

   ```
   $ rustup target add riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
   $ rustup component add llvm-tools
   ```

## Build libbaochip_sdk.a Library

To build the library file for linking with C projects, do this:

```
$ cd code/baochip-sdk/
$ make
building target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/libbaochip_sdk.a
cargo clean
     Removed 15 files, 16.4MiB total
cargo build --lib --release
   Compiling baochip-sdk v0.1.0 (/home/sam/code/baochip-sdk)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.19s
```

You'll need to `#include "baochip_sdk.h"` in your C code. Also be sure to add a
gcc `-I<path>` argument with the correct relative path from your Makefile to
[baochip_sdk.h](baochip_sdk.h) in the root of this repo.


## Building the Examples

This uses a Makefile to orchestrate `cargo build` along with some llvm tools
for post build binary manipulation and a couple Python scripts to sign and UF2
pack the firmware blob.


### examples/hello_c.c (C linked to Rust)

This one uses C for the application logic (hello world) and Rust for the
hardware drivers. The C code has a hello world that gets linked with picolibc
and a Rust wrapper. The Rust code initializes the hardware, provides a UART
driver, and calls the `main()` exported by the C library. The C code is at
[examples/hello_c.c](examples/hello_c.c).

```
$ make hello_c

## Copy and Run UF2 File on macOS

Once you have a signed and packed UF2 file, you can copy and run it like this
(on macOS; YYMV for Linux):

```
$ cp hello_c.uf2 /Volumes/BAOCHIP && sync
$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4   # assumes /Volumes/BAOCHIP was /dev/disk4s1
Unmount of all volumes on disk4 was successful
```

After the disk is unmounted, press the Dabao PROG button to run the code
(assuming your dabao bootloader is configured with bootwait enabled).

## Pinout & Electrical Ratings

- Bunnie says the GPIO uses a 22 nm cell that can do **3.3V** IO with **12mA**
  current drive and **2kV HBM** ESD protection.

- GPIO outputs **can do Pull-Up**, but **pull-down is not supported**.

- ️⚡️🔥☠️ **DO NOT USE 5V**. IO is not 5V tolerant.

- Dabao v3 schematic:
  [github.com/baochip/dabao/blob/main/dabao_v3c.pdf](https://github.com/baochip/dabao/blob/main/dabao_v3c.pdf)

- Bootloader (boot1) serial console: **TX=PB14**, **RX=PB13**, 1M baud 8N1<br>
  (source [README-baochip.md](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/README-baochip.md))


## Division and Precision Timing

Notes from Bunnie on relative cost of math operations on the main CPU:
- Division takes 34 cycles
- Shifts use a barrel shifter, but there's a potential for data dependencies to
  slow the pipeline. So, shift may take 1 or 2 cycles.

Tracking time is really easy with TICKTIMER if you only need a 1 ms tick for
the counter. But, it's potentially desirable to have separate µs and ms time
functions available for fine and coarse resolution timing.

1. If you use a 1 MHz tick, getting 1 µs timer resolution 64-bit counter is
   just a matter of two register reads, a shift, and an or. But, to get a 1 ms
   timestamp, you'd need to do a `/ 1000`. Division is slow, so it would be
   nice to avoid that overhead.

2. If you use a 1/1024 ms tick (1.024 MHz), you can calculate ms as
   ```
   let ms = tick >> 10;
   ```
   and µs as
   ```
   let us = (tick * 1000) >> 10;   // or simplify fraction: (tick * 125) >> 7
   ```
   In both cases, you can avoid the division. You can also use ticks directly
   if you don't need the time of precise delays to be specified in SI units.


## UART Serial Console

For UART serial debug output, you need a serial monitor that can do 1Mbaud. On
Linux, this is easy. But, on macOS, you need a serial monitor that uses the
IOSSIOSPEED ioctl to set non-standard baud rates (`screen` won't work).
Homebrew's [picocom](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/picocom) reportedly
works. My [hbaud](https://github.com/samblenny/hbaud) works. The paid "Serial"
app on the App Store might work. NOTE: This is for UART serial. USB CDC is
different.

To read debug serial port log messages:

1. Solder 2.54mm header pins to your Dabao so you can put it in a breadboard.

2. Find a fast USB serial adapter that supports 1 Mbps. Adapters using FTDI,
   CP2102, or CP2102N chips are a good bet. The Raspberry Pi Debug Probe seems
   to work.

3. Wire up your serial adapter:

   | FTDI Adapter | Dabao     |
   | ------------ | --------- |
   | TX           | PB13 (RX) |
   | RX           | PB14 (TX) |
   | GND          | GND       |

   | Pi Debug Probe   | Dabao     |
   | ---------------- | --------- |
   | Orange Wire (TX) | PB13 (RX) |
   | Yellow Wire (RX) | PB14 (TX) |
   | Black Wire       | GND       |

4. Connect the adapter, find its device with `ls /dev/tty*` or whatever, then
   start a serial monitor with `screen -fn $ADAPTER_TTY 1000000` or whatever.

5. Connect Dabao to USB. You should see `boot0 console up` and so on.


### Boot Messages Example: USB Host

A typical boot when plugged into a USB host (computer) might look like this:

```
boot0 console up

~~boot0 up! (v0.9.16-1881-g3e4b0b657)~~

boot0 console up

~~boot0 up! (v0.9.16-1881-g3e4b0b657)~~

boot1 udma console up, CPU @ 350MHz!

~~Boot1 up! (v0.9.16-2542-g944a8082e: Towards Beta-0)~~

Configured board type: Dabao
Boot bypassed because bootwait was enabled
USB device ready
USB is connected!
```

Note the `USB is connected!` on the last line.


### Boot Messages Example: USB Power Only

A typical boot when only connected to USB power might look like this:
```
boot0 console up

~~boot0 up! (v0.9.16-1881-g3e4b0b657)~~

boot0 console up

~~boot0 up! (v0.9.16-1881-g3e4b0b657)~~

boot1 udma console up, CPU @ 350MHz!

~~Boot1 up! (v0.9.16-2542-g944a8082e: Towards Beta-0)~~

Configured board type: Dabao
Boot bypassed because bootwait was enabled
USB device ready
```

Note the absence of `USB is connected!` for the last line. Here, the bootloader
shell is bound to the UART port. If you press the enter key, you should see
something like:

```

Command not recognized:
Commands include: reset, echo, altboot, boot, bootwait, idmode, localecho, uf2, boardtype, audit, lockdown, paranoid, self_destruct
```

Then, if you type `audit` + enter, you should see something like this:

```
audit
Board type reads as: Dabao
Boot partition is: Ok(PrimaryPartition)
Semver is: v0.9.16-2542-g944a8082e

** System did not meet minimum requirements for security **
```


## USB CDC Serial Console

The Baochip bootloader and baremetal app both provide a simple shell interface.
The boot log messages always go to the UART serial port, but the shell binding
depends on whether the USB port is connected to power only or to a USB host:

- Connected to Power Only: Shell binding goes to UART serial port. In this
  case, the last UART log line is `USB device ready` (not `...connected!`).

- Connected to Computer (USB host): Shell binding goes to USB CDC serial port.
  In this case, the last UART log line should be `USB is connected!`.


## Docs, Refs, and Downloads


### Dabao Board (Bao1x dev board)

- ⚠️ The first batch of boards (e.g. from 39C3) shipped with alpha firmware
  that must be updated.

  **Dabao Bootloader Update Instructions**:
  [xous-core/README-baochip.md](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/README-baochip.md)

  The bootloader update instructions describe building `bao1x-alt-boot1.uf2`
  and `bao1x-boot1.uf2` from source, but you can also get them from bunnie's CI
  builds at
  [ci.betrusted.io/latest-ci/baochip/bootloader/](https://ci.betrusted.io/latest-ci/baochip/bootloader/)

- Board design files: [github.com/baochip/dabao](https://github.com/baochip/dabao)


### Bao1x Chip (CSP Package)

These notes and documentation links should help understand peripheral IP blocks
used in the Bao1x SoC. Much of this came from the baochip discord server's
not-rust channel.

- Baochip website with various docs links: [baochip.com](https://baochip.com)

- uDMA block is from Pulp platform from University of Bologna/ETH Zurich:<br>
  [docs](https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/core-v-mcu/doc-src/udma_subsystem.html),
  [sample drivers](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-rt/tree/master/drivers)

  uDMA provides UART, I2C, Camera, SPI, SDIO, and ADC peripheral access by DMA

- IRQArray is meant to be an alternative to NVIC that will work better with
  virtual memory. IRQs are split into banks of 16 with each bank getting a
  separate page of memory. This allows drivers to have their own memory spaces.

- CPU cluster register group: [docs](https://ci.betrusted.io/bao1x-cpu/)

  These RV32 registers provide access to IRQArray, timers, and suspend/resume
  features.

- Peripheral cluster register group: [docs](https://ci.betrusted.io/bao1x/)

  These RV32 registers provide access to math/crypto accelerators, TRNG, UDMA,
  BIO, and a variety of other as yet somewhat mysterious peripherals.

- PLL programming is not well documented yet. Best reference is the
  [rust source](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/libs/bao1x-hal/src/clocks.rs).
  But, the bootloader sets up the clocks and the UART, so this might not matter
  unless you need to do something like adjust the main clock to hit a specific
  I2S bit clock rate.

- Bare metal linker file:<br>
  [xous-core/baremetal/src/platform/bao1x/link.x](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/baremetal/src/platform/bao1x/link.x)

- Existing BIO examples depend on Xous APIs. There isn't much documentation yet
  on how to use it outside of Xous (as of Jan 10, 2026). BIO is relevant for
  handling timing sensitive IO like I2S, 1-wire, or LED string drivers.

  Current no_std BIO drivers:

These have some useful info for dev environment setup along with building,
signing, and flashing apps for Baochip:

2. https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/README-baochip.md


## Binary Signing and UF2 Notes

The bao1x bootloader expects binary images to be ed25519ph signed with  using
the developer key that's available at
[betrusted-io/xous-core/devkey/dev.key](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/devkey/dev.key).

The xous-core repo includes tools to go from ELF binary, to signed ELF binary,
to bootloader-ready UF2 file. These scripts and tools from xous-core are
involved in signing and UF2 creation:

- Windows PowerShell script to sign and deploy official build artifacts for
  Dabao using a hardware signing token:<br>
  [xous-core/baosign.ps1](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/baosign.ps1)

- This tool converts .img pre-sign binaries (derived from ELF binaries) into
  UF2 encoded signed binaries. There's some moderately complicated stuff going
  on with wrapping the object code in a file structure that includes public
  keys, padding, version info, the signature, and maybe a couple other
  things.<br>
  [xous-core/tools/src/sign_image.rs](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/tools/src/sign_image.rs) (library functions)<br>
[xous-core/tools/src/bin/sign_image.rs](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/tools/src/bin/sign_image.rs) (command)

  The public keys that get embedded in the signed output image come from:<br>
  [xous-core/libs/bao1x-api/src/*.rs](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/tree/main/libs/bao1x-api/src/pubkeys)

  The developer key private key PEM comes from:<br>
  [xous-core/devkey/dev.key](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/devkey/dev.key)

  The developer key public key certificate PEM comes from:<br>
  [xous-core/devkey/dev-x509.crt](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/devkey/dev-x509.crt)


- This section of the Xous `xtask` tool shows the command line arguments that
  it uses when invoking `sign_image.rs` to sign a baremetal binary:<br>
  [xous-core/xtask/src/builder.rs#L978-L1000](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/32c5d492cdd745f2f36163564025a9a93c90422a/xtask/src/builder.rs#L978-L1000)

  That ends up doing the equivalent of:

   ```
    target/debug/sign-image --loader-image \
    target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/baremetal-presign.img \
    --loader-key devkey/dev.key --loader-output \
    target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/baremetal.img \
    --min-xous-ver v0.9.8-791 --sig-length 768 --with-jump --bao1x \
    --function-code baremetal
   ```

- This will convert an ELF file to a pre-sign object (.img file):

   ```
    target/debug/copy-object \
    xous-core/target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/baremetal \
    target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/baremetal-presign.img --bao1x
   ```

  You can get a help message for `copy-object` from xous-core by doing:

  ```
  cargo run --package tools --bin copy-object
  ```


## Build & Run sign_image.rs

1. Install rust with rustup

2. Clone xous-core:
   ```
   git clone --depth 100 https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core.git
   ```

3. Build sign-image:
   ```
   cargo run -p tools --bin sign-image
   ```

4. Run it:
   ```
   target/debug/sign-image --help
   ```


## Alternate Signing Method

My [signer.py](signer.py) script implements a functionally equivalent signing
operation to `sign-image` invoked with the baremetal bao1x options listed
above. The point of my signer script is to make it possible to sign without
pulling in xous-core as a dependency.

The signer requires that you convert the ELF file to a binary blob of machine
code in the style of `copy-object`. My Makefile does the ELF to machine code
extraction step using `llvm-objcopy`, with some help from the linker script.


## Understanding the Blob Format and Early Boot

The pre-sign image created by `copy-object` is meant to be copied to RRAM (the
Baochip equivalent of flash) for XIP (execute in place) access by the CPU. The
blob contains:

1. A header, beginning with a jump instruction, that's sufficient to
   reconstruct statics from the `.data` section. This is a method to compress
   `.data`, which typically has many zero bytes. This matters particularly for
   the bootloaders, which are space constrained to fit in small ReRAM slots.

2. The `.text` section with executable code (assembly and compiled rust code).
   This begins with init code to set up hardware, prepare the `.data` section
   in SRAM, zero the `.bss` section in SRAM, configure interrupt and trap
   handlers, set the stack pointer, and jump to `_start`.

3. The `.rodata` section with read-only data that stays in ReRAM (flash).

For my purposes, compressing `.data` is probably not necessary. But, my code in
`.text` will still be responsible for initializing `.data` and `.bss` by some
means.

If using `objcopy` to create a blob instead of `copy-object`, it will be
important to ensure section start offsets within the blob file stay consistent
with the LMA addresses in the ELF binary. This may involve padding. Making sure
the blob gets written to the correct RRAM start address happens by setting the
offset in the UF2 file (see `signer.py` or `sign_image.rs`).

For link script info and `.data` initialization details, see:

- [xous-core/baremetal/src/platform/bao1x/link.x](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/baremetal/src/platform/bao1x/link.x)

- [xous-core/baremetal/src/platform/bao1x/irq.rs](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/d26ce7fbf11fef8aac24adea93f557341dd0600f/baremetal/src/platform/bao1x/irq.rs#L10-L28)

Bunnie says, when the Bao1x bootloader jumps to the initial JAL instruction at
the start of the signed blob in ReRAM, interrupts are guaranteed to be off.
Also, at that point, the UDMA UART baud rate, buffers, and clocks will be set
up and ready to use (but it's best to re-initialize them anyway).


## UDMA Notes

Some relevant UDMA UART code snippets from xous-core:

- TX usage (`putc` definition):
  [xous-core/libs/bao1x-hal/src/debug.rs#L12-L26](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/5eec0702f9a989144739ff08d419ed7445c2ecc9/libs/bao1x-hal/src/debug.rs#L12-L26)

- `get_handle` definition:
  [xous-core/libs/bao1x-hal/src/udma/uart.rs#L110-L125](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/5eec0702f9a989144739ff08d419ed7445c2ecc9/libs/bao1x-hal/src/udma/uart.rs#L110-L125)

- `write` definition:
  [xous-core/libs/bao1x-hal/src/udma/uart.rs#L184-L224](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/5eec0702f9a989144739ff08d419ed7445c2ecc9/libs/bao1x-hal/src/udma/uart.rs#L184-L224)

- `udma_enqueue` definition:
  [xous-core/libs/bao1x-hal/src/udma/mod.rs#L253-L274](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/libs/bao1x-hal/src/udma/mod.rs#L253-L274)

**CAUTION:** The UDMA engine expects its source data to come from the IFRAM
buffers, **which are outside the regular SRAM**. The IFRAM address space is a
totally different thing, a 256kB region of buffers mapped to its own address
range starting at 0x50000000.

IFRAM address details:

```
pub const HW_IFRAM0_MEM:     usize = 0x50000000;
pub const HW_IFRAM0_MEM_LEN: usize = 131072;  // 128 kB
pub const HW_IFRAM1_MEM:     usize = 0x50020000;
pub const HW_IFRAM1_MEM_LEN: usize = 131072;  // 128 kB
```

The only way to send anything on the UDMA UART is to set up a DMA transaction.
So, you have to set up an `unsafe` buffer in IFRAM, copy your data there, then
start a UDMA transaction to read from the buffer.


## USB Openmoko PIDs

Baochip has the following Openmoko USB VID PID pairs (see openmoko-usb-oui
[pull request](https://github.com/openmoko/openmoko-usb-oui/pull/69)):

| VID    | PID    | Description                         |
|--------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| 0x1d50 | 0x6196 | Baochip-1x SoC bootloader           |
| 0x1d50 | 0x6197 | Dabao breakout board for Baochip-1x |
| 0x1d50 | 0x6198 | Baosec security token               |
